# Contributing to DeepChain

We love your input! We want to make contributing to DeepChain as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Development Process

We use GitHub Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python code formatting
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Write docstrings for all public functions
- Use type hints where possible

## Testing

We use `pytest` for testing. To run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Documentation

- Use Google style docstrings
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
- Update the API documentation when adding new features

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

1. What version of Python are you using?
2. What operating system are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

### Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

1. Clear description of the feature
2. Use cases
3. Expected behavior
4. Alternative solutions considered

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the documentation with details of any new functionality
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer
